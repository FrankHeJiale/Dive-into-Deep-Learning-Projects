Dive into Deep Learning — Project Portfolio by Frank He Jiale

A chapter-by-chapter implementation journey through *Dive into Deep Learning (D2L).  
Each chapter includes 
  codes from the book that has been used and modified to learn skills
  a hands-on PyTorch project designed for both deep learning practice and professional showcasing.



Overview

This repository documents my learning progress through the book *Dive into Deep Learning (D2L) using PyTorch.  
Each chapter corresponds to one self-contained project that demonstrates both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.
